It shows that the winning seed and who wins by the most point increases as the rounds increase as well. The winning seed is much lower than the winning points as there are more points scored in games. I did not think there would be such a discrepancy between rounds three and four, as round 4 does not have any winning points or seeds. By the time round seven approaches, the winning seed is always the better team and the points are scored in more rapid fashion. "

This shows that the seeding is a good indicator of a teams success, but it also manages to get the times where a team surpasses or falls below expectations. In those instances, it shows that a team is more likely to do better than its seeding than those are to do worse."
